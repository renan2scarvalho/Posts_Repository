# This notebook is about my first Data Science job interview

So my first job interview happened couple months before this repository been born, and the creation of my website for a personal portfolio (triggered I guess).

In this notebook I approach some *pandas* questions that happened during the interview, using ficticious samples created randomly by myself in order to ease the understanding, even though the questions are in majority simple.

Also, as a way to dig a little over machine learning, I clustered the small sample of customers, and made a simple analysis over three main parameters, which are monetary (average ticket per consumer), frequency (how frequent are the consumers), and recency (how recent are the customers). Hope you like it!


PS: I didn't get the job, damn it! =/
