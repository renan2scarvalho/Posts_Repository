# Skewed Data
This notebook shows some transformations to be used in skewed distributions, in order to reach a normal distributed-like pattern. This transformations are a critical part of data cleansing. The transformations, presented with a briefing for applications, are:

1. square root
2. reciprocal
3. logarithmic
4. exponential
5. power transformation
6. arcsine transformation
7. Box-Cox transformation
8. Yeo-Johnson transformation
